      PROJECT BURN
--------------------------

Project Burn is a cryptocurrency that runs on Binance
Chain. It has a total supply of 10 billion coins. The project
team will burn 100 million coins every month for the next 50
months, which is equivalent to 4 years and 2 months. This
will reduce the supply by 50%, leaving only 5 billion coins in
circulation
